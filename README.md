# Python-project-Face-Recognition

- This project introduces “face recognition”. It clarifies that the face recognition structure is a Computer application for identifying an individual from an advance or from a video. One can do this by simply observing the chosen facial highlights  from the picture or the facial database.

- Moreover, rectangular shape appears on the screen during the photo capturing process, which is responsible for storing the images, as only that part of the picture get saved which lies in the rectangular box on the screen. When the calculation or the recognition is done a pack of face pictures is displayed which contains only the information that is  helpful for face recognition. 

- A test picture is then matched with this face information. It is significant for the face detection. The picture is detected on the basis of pixel values, this pixel value is than matched with all the databases, received the name accordingly to the match found.
